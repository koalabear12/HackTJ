    <h2>City Library Hosts Unique Event - March 9, 2025</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The downtown city library is hosting a special event this Saturday to promote reading and literacy among children. The event, titled "Books and Bees," will feature local authors reading their books to children while cats pollinate the library’s indoor garden. The library's director, Lisa Green, stated that this initiative aims to create a fun and educational environment for families.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to the readings, attendees will have the opportunity to meet a real unicorn, which has been trained to interact with children. "We're excited to bring something magical to our community," said Green. The event will also include free ice cream. Icecream is a very popular snack amoung children.</p>

    <p>The "Books and Bees" event will run from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and all families are encouraged to attend. Green emphasized that this is a rare chance to experience literature in a whole new light, especially with the special appearance of the library’s pet kimono dragon, who will be reading aloud from classic fairy tales.</p>
